# Sieve-of-Eratosthenes
This page runs javascript code to find prime numbers up to 2,000,000. 

The code was developed based off logic provided on this page: http://brianhan.tumblr.com/post/46454945029.

I added a check to stop the inner loop once the outer loop had iterated beyond the sqrt of the max number entered. 

This project utilizes Bootstrap, FontAwesome, Google Fonts, Custom CSS, and Javascript and is responsive to fit screen size.
